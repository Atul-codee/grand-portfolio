# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built to represent my professional identity on the web.  
It serves as a digital resume where visitors can learn about me, explore my skills, browse through the projects I have built, and find ways to contact me.  

The website is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly so it looks good across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
My goal with this project was not only to showcase my work but also to practice modern web development concepts like layout design, responsive grids, and interactive elements.
